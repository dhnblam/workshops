## Call for Participation

**Lightning talks (CfP)**

The workshop «Digital Humanities Support Units in the Nordic and Baltic Countries» will be held online via Zoom prior to the 6th annual conference of the Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries, on Monday, March 14th & Tuesday, March 15th, 13:00-16:00 CET. The workshop aims to connect DH support units at libraries, archives and museums in the Nordic and Baltic countries and the people affiliated with them for an exchange of experience, much needed discussion, and an exploration of options for collaboration.

Participants are encouraged to submit proposals for short presentations (lightning talks of up to 5mins) about their DH support units. The presentation should address one specific topic related to the workshop theme.

**Workshop themes / possible parameters to address**

* How is DH research supported through the DH support unit? 
* Who is the target group for this support?
* How is the DH support unit organized? Where is it placed within an institution (cf. policy)?
* Does the DH support unit provide access to digital collections and if so, how?
* Does the DH support unit preserve digital projects and research data preserved? How are access and long-term storage handled?
* Does the DH support unit provide training and if so, is it also provided outside the scope of the institutions’ collections?
* Is dissemination of DH research part of the support?
* In regards to an open definition of ‘digital humanities’: are fields outside of what can be described as ‘the humanities’ considered, too?
